        <h3>Can emission trading markets help India tackle its industrial pollution crisis?</h3>
        <p>ETS is gaining traction as a market-based instrument to reduce industrial emissions. However, questions around transparency, reproducibility, state capacity, and policy design and clarity threaten the viability of this approach in the Indian context.</p>

        <h3>Why India must start viewing air pollution and climate change as two sides of the same coin</h3>
        <p>The recent Working Group 1 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finds that particulate matter (PM or simply, fine particles) have ‘masked’ the impact of greenhouse gas emissions generated over the last century by about a third. If air pollution mitigation ‘worsens’ global warming, must we rethink pollution controls at all? Not quite.</p>
